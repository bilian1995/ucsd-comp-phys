Thanks for reading this READ ME file, you are of a very smart person ;-)

For HW1:

feynmanK.h: contains the function definitions used in HW1-template.cpp, you will need to fix the A factor and the fillPropagator1D function

hw1_template.cpp: All constants are defined at near the top of the file. You need to add some code to compute expectation values and print out results.

To Build, do:
make

Good Luck!
